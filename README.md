# pocketblock

*pocketblock* is the barebones form of a new class of teaching-oriented cryptographic primitives called *bantamweight cryptography*. It's expressed in a visual syntax that centers around *blockwise* movement of alphanumeric values across a grid, making it easily committed to memory, easily calculable by mind, and easily implemented by hand -- a handheld algorithm, if you will, easily tucked into one's cebebral pocket.


## pockenacci

*pockenacci* is a simple *pocket*block cipher. It's an SPN (Substitution-Permutation Network) that contains an ARX-like (Add, Rotate, XOR, but without the XOR) round function and additive Fibonacci-like key schedule. For simplicity, pockenacci operates on a 6x6 grid of the alphanumeric character set of a-z0-9 (36 characters). The material in this repo implements pockenacci (demo + DIY templates); for a guide to pockenacci, reach out to justin@justintroutman.com.

### what's here?

This repository contains a collection of source material (e.g., LaTeX/TikZ/PGF, HTML, CSS, et cetera) that implements the *pocketblock* cipher *pockenacci*. The source is prepared with enough verbosity to be easily integrated into an educator's curricula, as well as easily tweaked by the educator with minimal friction.
